Book-Crossing dataset

With the increase in ecommerce and use of internet applications, recommender systems are used in hundreds of algorithms today to suggest products and services to customers and users around the world. There are several online retailers like Amazon, eBay, Netflix and Facebook who vigorously depend on recommender systems in determining similar customers and items that are likely to of interest of given user. Recommendation system helps in filtering the large amount of data generated and provide adequate information which can be used to increase sale or maintain current usersâ€™ interests. There are different approaches to implement recommender system like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, rule-based filtering and hybrid approach. Collaborative filtering gives recommendation based on preference of similar users. Content based approach makes recommendation to user based on items with similar content in user profile or items that user preferred in the past. We are using collaborative filtering approach for building the recommender system for this project and recommend top N book recommendations to the users.
